# Big Data

**Understanding Volume, Velocity, and Variety**

---

## What is Big Data?

> **Big Data** refers to data that displays the characteristics of volume, velocity, and variety (**the 3 Vs**) to an extent that makes the data unsuitable for management by a relational database management system.

---

## The 3 Vs of Big Data

- **Volume**: the quantity of data to be stored

- **Velocity**: the speed at which data is entering the system

- **Variety**: the variations in the structure of the data to be stored

## Pioneers of Big Data Technology

<div class="columns">

<div>

**Google** (to index the web)
- Google File System (GFS)
- MapReduce (distributed data processing)
- BigTable (key-value store)

**Amazon** (for web commerce at scale)
- Dynamo (key-value store)

</div>

<div>

**Facebook** (for social graph processing)
- Cassandra

**Today**: Tech advancement has increased the opportunity for organizations to generate and track data (e.g. via personal connected devices)

# Volume: Handling Large Amounts of Data

---

## Units of Data Volume

| Amount of Data | Name     | Abbreviation |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 1024 bytes     | kibibyte | KiB          |
| 1024 KiB       | mebibyte | MiB          |
| 1024 MiB       | gibibyte | GiB          |
| 1024 GiB       | tebibyte | TiB          |
| 1024 TiB       | pebibyte | PiB          |
| 1024 PiB       | exbibyte | EiB          |
| 1024 EiB       | zebibyte | ZiB          |

**Note**: kibi-, mibi-, gibi- etc. increase by 1024x (2¬π‚Å∞), while kilo-, mega-, giga- increase by 1000x

---

## Scale of Modern Storage

- The largest storage systems today (e.g., cloud storage at Amazon, Google, Microsoft) are approaching a **Zebibyte**

- That's 1,024 Exbibytes!
- Or approximately 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 bytes

---

## Two Approaches to Handle Volume

**Scale Up (Vertical Scaling)**
- Increase the CPU, RAM, Disk of each storage machine
- Keep the number of machines fixed

**Scale Out (Horizontal Scaling)**
- Keep the CPU, RAM, Disk of each machine fixed
- Increase the number of machines

## Comparing Scaling Approaches

|           | Capacity        | Cost             | Coordination    |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Scale Up  | üëé machine limit | üëé specialized hw | üëç few machines  |
| Scale Out | üëç add machines  | üëç commodity hw   | üëé many machines |

## Why RDBMS Struggles with Volume

- **RDBMS requires high coordination**
  - Tables are related via common attributes
  - Maintaining referential integrity across distributed systems is challenging

- **Can only scale up**
  - Limited by physical machine constraints
  - Results in lower capacity and higher cost

- **Result**: RDBMS is unsuitable for Big Data Volume

---

## NoSQL: The Volume Solution

- **NoSQL compromises on relational power**
  - Limited transaction support

- **In return, can scale out**
  - Add more commodity hardware
  - Higher capacity at lower cost
  - Better suited for handling volume

---

# Velocity: Handling Speed of Data

---

## Velocity Challenge Example

- **Example**: A cloud storage system like Google Cloud Storage handles **~10 million requests per second**

- **Problem**: If a scaled-up machine can handle ~10,000 requests per second, you would need **1,000 machines**!

---

## Velocity Requires Scaling Out

- High velocity cannot be handled by a single machine
- **Must scale out** (same as for volume)
- RDBMS is not a good fit for velocity challenges
- NoSQL systems designed for distributed request handling

---

# Variety: Handling Different Data Types

---

## Structured vs. Unstructured Data

**Structured Data**
- Data that conforms to a predefined model (e.g., a table schema)
- RDBMS requires this!

**Unstructured Data**
- Can be anything, does not conform to a model
- Examples: videos, texts, emails, sensor data, social media posts

**Semi-structured Data**
- Parts are structured and parts are unstructured
- Examples: JSON documents, XML files

---

## The Real World Challenge

- The real world is **full of unstructured data**
- Most valuable data doesn't fit neatly into tables
- Examples:
  - Customer reviews (text)
  - Product images (binary)
  - Click streams (logs)
  - IoT sensor readings (time series)

---

## NoSQL Approach to Variety

**Flexible Schema**
- Ingest unstructured data first
- Impose structure as needed for applications
- Structure during retrieval and processing, not storage

**Benefits**
- Adapt to changing data formats
- Store diverse data types together
- No upfront schema design required

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Big Data is defined by the **3 Vs**: Volume, Velocity, and Variety

2. **Scaling Out** (horizontal) is preferred over Scaling Up (vertical) for Big Data

3. **RDBMS** struggles with Big Data because it requires high coordination and structured data

4. **NoSQL** trades relational power for the ability to scale out and handle variety

5. Modern cloud storage systems are approaching **Zebibyte** scale
