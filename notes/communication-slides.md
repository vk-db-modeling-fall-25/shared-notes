# Technical Communication
## Essential Skills for CS Success

**College-Wide Learning Outcome**

*The ability to engage effectively in verbal, non-verbal, written, and/or symbolic expression*

---

## Learning Objectives

### By the end of this session, you will understand:

1. **Communicate** purpose, theme, or central message
2. **Account** for audience and context  
3. **Follow** disciplinary conventions
4. **Utilize** supporting materials/sources and evidence

<!-- Speaker notes:
- Ask students to self-assess their current communication skills (1-5)
- These objectives apply to ALL forms of CS communication
-->

---

## Why Communication Matters in CS

> ## Clear communication ‚ü∫ Clear thinking

**If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough**

<!-- Speaker notes:
- This Einstein quote resonates strongly in technical fields
- Communication is bidirectional with understanding
-->

## Communication Scenarios in CS Careers

![width:500px](../media/comms-in-cs.excalidraw.svg)

---

## ü§î **Reflection Activity** (2 min)

### Think-Pair-Share:

1. **Think**: One time poor communication caused a problem in your CS work
2. **Pair**: Share with your neighbor
3. **Share**: Volunteer examples for the class

*What could have been done differently?*

---

# Objective 1
## Communicate Purpose, Theme, or Central Message


---

## The What-Why-How Framework

| Element  | Purpose                     | Key Question         |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **WHAT** | State what you built/solved | "What is it?"        |
| **WHY**  | Explain why it matters      | "Why should I care?" |
| **HOW**  | Brief technical approach    | "How does it work?"  |

---

## Example: Elevator Pitch

### ‚ùå **Bad Example**
*"So, um, my project uses React and Node.js with MongoDB. I implemented JWT authentication and used Redux for state management. There's also a REST API with 15 endpoints..."*

### ‚úÖ **Good Example**  
*"I built an app that helps college students save 30% on textbooks by connecting them directly for exchanges. Think of it as 'Uber for textbook sharing.' In our pilot, we saved students $15,000."*

<!-- Speaker notes:
- Bad: All technical details, no value proposition
- Good: Clear problem, solution, impact
-->

---

## Quick Examples: Clear Purpose

<div style="font-size: 24px;">

| Context            | Bad                 | Good                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Comment**   | `// Processes data` | `// Prepares data for statistical analysis`    |
| **Commit Message** | `Fixed stuff`       | `Fix: DB connection leak (Bug #1648)`          |
| **Email Subject**  | `Update`            | `URGENT: DB connection leak - Action required` |
| **Bug Report**     | `Button problem`    | `[CRITICAL] Payment button fails silently`     |

</div>

---

## üéØ **Practice: Elevator Pitch** (5 min)

### Your turn! Create a 30-second pitch:

1. Pick your current/recent project
2. Apply What-Why-How:
   - **WHAT**: One sentence description
   - **WHY**: Problem solved + impact
   - **HOW**: Key technical approach
3. Practice with a partner

---

# Objective 2
## Account for Audience and Context

**One size does NOT fit all**

---

## Tailoring to Your Audience

### Consider:
- **Technical level**: How much do they know?
- **Primary concerns**: What keeps them up at night?
- **Preferred format**: Email? Slack? Document?
- **Time available**: 30 seconds or 30 minutes?
- **Cultural context**: Formal? Casual? Direct?

## Scenario: Security Breach
### Same Information, Different Audiences

You discovered a SQL injection vulnerability that exposed customer data.

How do you communicate this to:
1. Fellow engineers?
2. Your manager?
3. Customer service team?
4. The public?

---

## Audience 1: Fellow Engineers

**Context**: Slack #engineering  
**Tone**: Technical, solution-focused

```
@channel SECURITY ALERT - SQL Injection in User Login

**Vulnerability Details:**
- Location: AuthController.java line 142
- Issue: Raw string concatenation in SQL query
- Attack vector: username = "admin' OR '1'='1' --"
- Fix: Parameterized queries deployed to prod
```

---

## Audience 2: Your Manager

**Context**: Email  
**Tone**: Impact-focused, professional

```
Subject: Security Incident Report - Resolved

Executive Summary:
We identified and patched a critical security vulnerability 
that potentially exposed customer credentials.

Business Impact:
- Affected users: ~50,000
- Downtime for fix: 0 minutes
- Compliance: GDPR notification required

Next Steps: Legal review, customer communication...
```

---

## Audience 3: Customer Service

**Context**: Team guide  
**Tone**: Clear, supportive

```markdown
# Customer Support Guide

## If customer asks "Was my account hacked?"
"We found and fixed a security vulnerability before 
any misuse was detected. As a precaution, we're asking 
some customers to reset passwords. Payment info was 
NOT affected."

## Escalation Path:
- Angry customers ‚Üí Team Lead
- Technical questions ‚Üí security@company
```

---

## Audience 4: The Public

**Context**: Social media  
**Tone**: Transparent, brief

```
We recently discovered and fixed a security issue 
affecting some user accounts. No payment info 
was compromised.

What we're doing:
‚úÖ Issue fixed immediately
‚úÖ Affected users being notified
‚úÖ Password resets as precaution

More: [link]
```

---

## üé≠ **Activity: Audience Adaptation** (8 min)

### Scenario: Your AI chatbot gave bad medical advice

**Write 3 versions** (2 sentences each):
1. **Technical team** (debug the issue)
2. **Hospital admin** (your client)  
3. **News reporter** (interview response)

**Share**: Read one version, class guesses the audience

---

# Objective 3
## Follow Disciplinary Conventions

**When in Rome... code as the Romans code**

---

## CS Writing Conventions

### Key Areas:
- **Style Guides**: Google, organization-specific
- **Documentation**: Javadoc, JSDoc, docstrings
- **Papers**: IEEE/ACM format
- **Code**: Naming conventions, formatting
- **Version Control**: Commit message formats

<!-- Speaker notes:
- Show actual examples of each
- Emphasize consistency over perfection
-->

---

## Example: Javadoc Convention

```java
/**
 * Calculates the final customer price including tax.
 * 
 * PURPOSE: Ensure consistent pricing across channels
 * 
 * @param basePrice Original price before adjustments
 * @return Final price with 15% tax minus 13% discount
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if price negative
 * 
 * Example:
 *   calculatePrice(100.00) returns 130.50
 */
public double calculatePrice(double basePrice) {
    // Implementation...
}
```

# Objective 4
## Utilize Supporting Materials & Evidence

**Show, don't just tell**

---

## Citations in CS

### IEEE Citation Style (Most Common)

**In-text**: Use bracketed numbers [1], [2], [3]

**Reference list**:
```

    distributed systems," in Proc. ICDCS, 
    Las Vegas, NV, USA, Jun. 2023, pp. 234-245.

## Data Visualization: Choose Wisely

| Data Type                 | ‚úÖ Good Choice | ‚ùå Bad Choice |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| **Performance over time** | Line graph    | Pie chart    |
| **Parts of whole**        | Stacked bar   | 3D pie       |
| **Correlation**           | Scatter plot  | Bar chart    |
| **Distribution**          | Histogram     | Pie chart    |
| **Comparison**            | Bar chart     | Area chart   |

*Remember: Every pixel should convey information*

---

## Example: Algorithm Performance

### ‚ùå **Bad: Pie Chart**
```
Algorithm Speed:
- Bubble Sort: 35%
- Quick Sort: 15%
- Merge Sort: 20%
```
*Percentages of what? No context!*

### ‚úÖ **Good: Line Graph**
```
Time (ms) vs Input Size (log scale)
Shows O(n¬≤) vs O(n log n) clearly
Actual measurements with units
```

---

## Quantitative Evidence

### ‚ùå **Vague**
*"This technology made the website faster"*

### ‚úÖ **Specific**
*"This technology reduced the 99th percentile page load time by **75%** (from 1200ms to 300ms), improving user retention by **18%**"*

**Always include**:
- Specific metrics
- Before/after comparison
- Impact on business/users

---

## üìä **Activity: Evidence Makeover** (5 min)

### Transform these vague statements:

1. "Our app is popular"
2. "The algorithm is efficient"
3. "Users like the new feature"

**Make them specific with**:
- Numbers/percentages
- Time frames
- Comparisons
- User impact

---

## Putting It All Together

### The Communication Checklist:

- [ ] **Purpose clear** in first 10 seconds?
- [ ] **Audience appropriate** language/detail?
- [ ] **Conventions followed** for the format?
- [ ] **Evidence supports** all claims?
- [ ] **Action items** clear (if needed)?

*Use for every email, document, presentation*
